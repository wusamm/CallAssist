# CallAssist
HTN project 2016

We wanted to create a personal assistant that would help with automating mundane but time consuming tasks such as calling to 
make dentist appointments, calling customer service desks, etc. We used Scale, an API for human labour. We had the user fill 
out a form indicating who they would like to call at what time, and what message they would like to deliver (eg. dentist, call ASAP, 
make me an appointment for 5pm tomorrow) and the user would receive an email back with the contents of the conversation (eg. its booked!)
